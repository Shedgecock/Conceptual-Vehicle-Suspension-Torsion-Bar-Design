## Project Objective

The project focuses on designing a steel torsion bar integrated into a vehicle's suspension to enhance wheel and tire dynamics. The bar connects an axle to a lever arm, ensuring the system adapts to road conditions while maintaining stability and resilience.

Key goals include:
- **Material Efficiency:** Using hollow torsion bar shafts to reduce weight without sacrificing strength.
- **Fatigue Resistance:** Calculating safety factors for critical components.
- **Compliance:** Ensuring the design adheres to engineering standards and specified performance metrics.
